\section{Introduction}
Geometric frustration, which arises when the lattice geometry gives rise to constraints that cannot be simultaneously satisfied, plays an important role in various kinds of magnetic systems. In particluar, antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice are typical examples of such geometric frustated spin systems and have attracted numerous interests in condensed matter physics. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spin-$1/2$ antiferromagetic Heisenberg model on triangular lattice, though a fully disordered resonating-valence-bond (RVB) \cite{Anderson1973} state was proposed as the possible ground state in the early years, several studies point to a 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el-ordered ground state thereafter \cite{PhysRevLett.99.127004,PhysRevLett.82.3899,PhysRevB.50.10048,PhysRevLett.60.2531}. When the second NN interactions are included which introduce further frustration, the system has a much richer phase diagram including a N\'{e}el phase, a phase with spin-wave selection of nontrivial ground states and a phase with incommensurate long-range order \cite{PhysRevB.42.4800,PhysRevB.46.11137}. All these studies have revealed that geometric frustated systems show quite different behavior from that of the non-frustated system.

On the other hand, exchange frustation in systems with strongly anisotropic magnetic interactions has been shown to be another promising approach to explore exotic quantum spin states. Like geometric frustation, the effect of exchange frustration is to prevent the formation of long range magnetic order and given raise to a residual ground-state entropy. The spin-$1/2$ Kitaev model \cite{Kitaev2006} on honeycomb lattice, which has both gapped and gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state (GS) supporting fractionalized excitations, is an example of a model with exchange frustration. As pointed out by Jackeli and Khaliullin \cite{Khaliullin2005, PhysRevLett.102.017205}, the elementary ingredients for realizing this highly anisotropic spin model are strong relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), electron interactions, and specific geometric structure: edge sharing octahedra with 90$^\circ$ TM-O-TM bond angles. Because of its theoretical importance and potential application in quantum computing, great efforts have been made to search a solid-state realization of the Kitaev model. It was first proposed to be realized in iridates $A_2$IrO$_3$ (A = Na or Li) \cite{PhysRevLett.105.027204,PhysRevLett.108.127204,Chun2015,PhysRevLett.110.076402,PhysRevB.87.220407,PhysRevLett.110.097204,PhysRevLett.108.127203,PhysRevB.92.024413,PhysRevLett.112.077204,Rau2014}, and then turned towards $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ \cite{PhysRevB.91.180401,Banerjee2016,PhysRevB.92.235119,PhysRevB.94.161106,PhysRevB.93.214431,PhysRevLett.118.107203,PhysRevLett.118.107203,PhysRevB.96.115103} in which Ir$^{4+}$/Ru$^{3+}$ ions are arranged in a honeycomb lattice and carry effective $j_{eff}=1/2$ moments. In fact, magnetic ions located at the center of edge-shared octahedra can not only form honeycomb lattice, but also triangular lattice (see Fig. \ref{fig:ModelDefinition}(a))and the Kitaev term can naturally be generalized to this scenario \cite{PhysRevB.93.104417,PhysRevB.89.014414}. Moreover, the symmetric off-diagonal $\Gamma$ term is allowed by symmetry and is a generic feature of S=$1/2$ models with edge sharing octahedra \cite {PhysRevLett.112.077204}. Kai Li \emph{et al.,} \cite{KaiLi2015} have studied the Heisenberg-Kitaev (HK) model on triangular lattice and a global phase diagram with a mean-field level chiral spin liquid (SL) as well as four magnetically ordered phases has been obtained. However, the effect of the $\Gamma$ term on triangluar lattice has not gain as much attention as on honeycomb lattice \cite{PhysRevLett.112.077204,Rau2014,PhysRevLett.118.107203,PhysRevB.96.115103,PhysRevB.93.214431,PhysRevB.100.144422}.

On the experimental side, the discovery of YbMgGaO$_4$ has invoked increasing interest in searching for rare-earth based spin-frustrated materials \cite{srep16419,PhysRevLett.115.167203,PhysRevB.94.035107,PhysRevB.96.054445,PhysRevB.97.184413,PhysRevB.97.125105,PhysRevB.96.075105,PhysRevLett.119.157201}. The Yb$^{3+}$ ions form a triangular layer and are surrounded by O$^{2-}$ which construct edge sharing octahedra \cite{srep16419,PhysRevLett.115.167203}. Extensive studies of magnetic properties using neutron scattering \cite{Nature20614,nphys3971,PhysRevLett.117.267202,PhysRevX.8.031001}, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) \cite{PhysRevLett.117.097201}, electron spin resonance (ESR) \cite{PhysRevLett.115.167203} reveal a possible gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state. More recently, a class of compounds \emph{AReCh}$_2$ (A=alkali, Re=rare-earth, Ch=O, S, Se) with perfect triangular lattices of rare-earth ions have been synthesized and explored. The magnetic susceptibilty and heat capacity data suggest no long-range magnetic order or spin freezing down to the lowest measurement temperature, which implies their candidacy for QSL state \cite{acsmaterialslett.9b00464,PhysRevMaterials.3.114413,arXiv1911.08036,Liu_2018,arXiv1911.12712}. The novel magnetic properties of these triangluar magnets may be attributed to the interplay of geometric frustation and exchange frustration induces by spin-orbit coupling.

Inspired by previous theoretical and experimental works, we study the Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$ ($J-K-\Gamma$) model on the triangular lattice. The $J-K-\Gamma$ model Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{equation}
    H=\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle \in \alpha \beta (\gamma)} \lbrack J \bm{S}_i \bm{\cdot} \bm{S}_j + K S_i^{\gamma} S_j^{\gamma} + \Gamma (S_i^{\alpha} S_j^{\beta} + S_i^{\beta} S_j^{\alpha}) \rbrack
    \label{eq:Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $\langle i,j \rangle$ denotes the NN bonds, $\gamma$ takes value $x$, $y$, or $z$ depending on the direction of the NN bond as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:ModelDefinition}(b), and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are the remaining directions. $J$ and $K$ are the magnitude of the Heisenberg and Kitaev interactions and $\Gamma$ the symmetric off-diagonal exchanges. To the best of our knowledge, no exact solution has been reported so far for the spin-$1/2$ Kitaev and/or $\Gamma$ model on the triangular lattice. Therefore, it remains conceptually interesting to investigate whether the QSL could exist as a possible ground state of the triangular $J-K-\Gamma$ model.

\section{Methods}
The full anisotropic Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:Hamiltonian} is no longer exactly solvable, even for the classical case. One, therefore, either has to rely on approximate analytical method or on numerical techniques. To determine the ground state of the Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:Hamiltonian}, we employ a combination of classical Monte Cralo simulation and ED calculation. Here, we briefly describe the methods we used. For convenience, we fix the energy scale with $\sqrt{J^2 + K^2 + \Gamma^2}=1$ and parametrize the exchanges using angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$
\begin{equation}
    J=\sin\alpha \sin\beta, \quad K=\sin\alpha \cos\beta, \quad \Gamma=\cos\alpha
    \label{eq:Parameters}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha \in [0, \pi]$ and $\beta \in [0, 2\pi]$ to cover the global phase diagram.

\subsection{Classical Monte Carlo}
\textcolor{red}{A introduction to classical Monte Carlo. Left blank currently.}

\subsection{Exact Diagonalization}
We perform a Lanczos ED calculation of the GS energy of the Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:Hamiltonian} on a 24-site cluster with periodic boundary conditions. To detect quantum phase transitions, the second derivatives of the ground-state energy, $-\partial^2E_0/\partial\alpha^2$ and $-\partial^2E_0/\partial\beta^2$ were computed and looked for singular features that indicate changes in the groun-state characteristics. Phases containing exactly solvable or well-understood points, such as the FM, 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el, stripe and Dual N\'{e}el can be readily identified. The remaining phases were identified mainly by examining the static structure factor
\begin{equation}
    S(\mathbf{Q}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{ij}e^{i\mathbf{Q}\cdot(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)} \langle \mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{S}_j \rangle
    \label{eq:StaticStructureFactor}
\end{equation}

To extract the moment direction of a magnetic ordered phase from a cluster ground state, we employ the method developed by Ji\v{r}\'{i} Chaloupka \emph{et  al} \cite{PhysRevB.94.064435}. The basic idea of this method is to measure the probabilities of the exact cluster ground state $|GS\rangle$ on cluster spin-coherent states with varying moment directions. The cluster spin-coherent state is a direct product of spin-1/2 coherent states on each site $i$
\begin{equation}
    |\Psi\rangle = \prod_{i=1}^N|\theta_i,\phi_i\rangle
    \label{eq:ClusterCoherentState}
\end{equation}
where the spin-1/2 coherent state
\begin{equation}
    |\theta, \phi \rangle = \mathcal{R}_z(\phi) \mathcal{R}_y(\theta) |\uparrow \rangle = e^{-i\phi S^z} e^{-i\theta S^y} |\uparrow\rangle
    \label{eq:Spin-1/2CoherentState}
\end{equation}
is fully polaried along the $(\theta, \phi)$ direction. Here the cubic axes are used (see Fig. \ref{fig:ModelDefinition}(c)), $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the conventional spherical angles, and $S^z |\uparrow \rangle = \frac{1}{2}|\uparrow \rangle$. By calculating the overlap with the exact cluster GS from ED, and maximizing the probability $P = |\langle \Psi | GS \rangle|^2$ with respect to $\theta$s and $\phi$s, we can then identify the classical pattern that best fits the exact GS.

\section{Classical Analysis}
To understand the effects of inculding this off-diagonal $\Gamma$ term, we first study the classical $J-K-\Gamma$ model where the spin operators are viewed as unit-vectors in three dimension. On our proceeding, we note that the global phase diagram has been obtained previously by using a combination of Luttinger-Tsiza (LT) and classical Monte Carlo simulations \cite{PhysRevB.92.165108}. Six different magnetic orderings: ferromagnet (FM), stripe, 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el order, nematic, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and dual-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal phases were found, see Fig. 2 in Ref \onlinecite{PhysRevB.92.165108}. Our classical Monte Carlo study give qualitatively the same phase diagram.

\subsection{Moment direction of the classcial FM order}
For the classical FM order, the energy of the $J-K-\Gamma$ model per lattice site is given by
\begin{equation}
    E_{FM}^{c} = (3J + K) + 2\Gamma(S^xS^y + S^yS^z + S^zS^x)
    \label{eq:EcFM}
\end{equation}
On this level, the moment direction of the classical FM state is determined solely by $\Gamma$ and the problem becomes finding the minimum and maximum of the multi-variable function $f(S^x, S^y, S^z) = S^xS^y + S^yS^z + S^zS^x$ with the constraint $|\mathbf{S}| = 1$. $f(S^x, S^y, S^z)$ takes maximum value $f_{max}=1$ at $S^x=S^y=S^z=\pm 1/\sqrt{3}$ and minimum value $f_{min}=-0.5$ when the conditions $S^x + S^y + S^z = 0$ and $|\mathbf{S}| = 1$ are fulfilled. That is to say, for $\Gamma > 0$ the moment of the classcial FM state prefers to lie in the plane that is perpendicular to the $[111]$ direction and when $\Gamma$ is negative, the moment would along the $[111]$ or $[\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}]$ direction.

\subsection{Moment direction of the classcial stripe order}

In the case of stripe order, there are three degenerate spin configurations as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b)-(d). For the spin configuration shown in Fig. \ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b), the energy of the $J-K-\Gamma$ model Hamiltonian is
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
    E_{StripeX}^{c} & = & -(J + K) + 2KS^xS^x \nonumber \\
        && + 2\Gamma(S^yS^z - S^xS^y - S^zS^x)
    \label{eq:EcStripeX}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
and the energy for spin configuration in Fig. \ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(c) and \ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(d) can be obtained by a cyclic permutation $x \rightarrow y \rightarrow z \rightarrow x$. The moment direction of the classical stripe order is determined by the anisotropy parameters $K$ and $\Gamma$. In general, $E_{StripeX}^{c}$ has three extreme points where the first derivatives equal zero
\begin{align}
    &\mathbf{S}_0: \quad S_{0}^{y}=-S_{0}^{z} = \pm1/\sqrt{2}, \quad S_{0}^{x} = 0\\
    &\mathbf{S}_1: \quad S_{1}^{y}=S_{1}^{z} = f_{1}(K, \Gamma), \quad S_{1}^{x} = g_{1}(K, \Gamma) S_{1}^{y}\\
    &\mathbf{S}_2: \quad S_{2}^{y}=S_{2}^{z} = f_{2}(K, \Gamma), \quad S_{2}^{x} = g_{2}(K, \Gamma) S_{2}^{y}
\end{align}
see Appendix A for their explicit expressions.

For $\Gamma=0, K>0$, the stripe order shown in Fig. \ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b) prefers to lie in the $yz$ plane. A definite positive $\Gamma$ would fix the ordered moment to the $\mathbf{S}_0$ direction and negative $\Gamma$ drives it to the $\mathbf{S}_1$ direction. When $\Gamma=0, K<0$, the moment would along the $x$ axis to have lowest energy and both positive and negative $\Gamma$ make it deviate from the $x$ axis and point the $\mathbf{S}_1$ direction.
