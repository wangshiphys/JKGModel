\section{\label{sec:SectionI}Introduction}
Geometric frustration, which arises when the lattice geometry gives rise to constraints that cannot be simultaneously satisfied, plays an important role in various kinds of magnetic systems. In particluar, antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice are typical examples of such geometric frustated spin systems and have attracted numerous interests in condensed matter physics. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spin-1/2 antiferromagetic Heisenberg model on triangular lattice, though a fully disordered resonating-valence-bond (RVB) \cite{Anderson1973} state was proposed as the possible ground state in the early years, several studies point to a 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el-ordered ground state thereafter \cite{PhysRevLett.99.127004,PhysRevLett.82.3899,PhysRevB.50.10048,PhysRevLett.60.2531}. When the second NN interactions are included which introduce further frustration, the system has a much richer phase diagram including the 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el state, the stripe state and a spin liquid state \cite{PhysRevB.91.014426,PhysRevB.92.041105,PhysRevB.92.140403,PhysRevB.96.165141,PhysRevB.93.144411,JPSJ.83.093707,PhysRevB.96.075116,PhysRevB.94.121111}. All these studies have revealed that geometric frustated systems show quite different behavior from that of the non-frustated system.

On the other hand, exchange frustation in systems with strongly anisotropic magnetic interactions has been shown to be another promising approach to explore exotic quantum spin states. Like geometric frustation, the effect of exchange frustration is to prevent the formation of long range magnetic order and given raise to a residual ground-state entropy. The spin-1/2 Kitaev model \cite{Kitaev2006} on honeycomb lattice, which has both gapped and gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state (GS) supporting fractionalized excitations, is an example of a model with exchange frustration. Because of its theoretical importance and potential application in quantum computing, great efforts have been made to search for a solid-state realization of the Kitaev model. Khaliullin \emph{et al.,} \cite{Khaliullin2005, PhysRevLett.102.017205} proposed to realized this highly anisotropic spin model in 4d/5d systems with a low spin state of $d^5$ configuration, such as iridates $A_2$IrO$_3$ (A = Na, Li). In these systems, the bond-directional interactions originate from the joint effects of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), electron interactions, $d^5$ configuration and 90$^\circ$ bond geometry formed by edge sharing octahedra. The resulting Hamiltonian is the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) model. It was later extended to contains more terms such as the off-diagonal $\Gamma$ term \cite{PhysRevLett.112.077204}. In fact, magnetic ions located at the center of edge-shared octahedra can not only form honeycomb lattice, but also triangular lattice (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ModelDefinition}(a))and the Kitaev term can naturally be generalized to this scenario \cite{PhysRevB.93.104417,PhysRevB.89.014414}. Moreover, the symmetric off-diagonal $\Gamma$ term is allowed by symmetry and is a generic feature of S=1/2 models with edge sharing octahedra \cite {PhysRevLett.112.077204}. Kai Li \emph{et al.,} \cite{KaiLi2015} have studied the KH model on triangular lattice and a global phase diagram with a mean-field level chiral spin liquid (SL) as well as four magnetically ordered phases has been obtained. However, the effect of the $\Gamma$ term on triangluar lattice has not gain as much attention as on honeycomb lattice \cite{PhysRevLett.112.077204,Rau2014,PhysRevLett.118.107203,PhysRevB.96.115103,PhysRevB.93.214431,PhysRevB.100.144422}.

On the experimental side, the discovery of YbMgGaO$_4$ has invoked increasing interest in searching for rare-earth based spin-frustrated materials \cite{srep16419,PhysRevLett.115.167203,PhysRevB.94.035107,PhysRevB.96.054445,PhysRevB.97.184413,PhysRevB.97.125105,PhysRevB.96.075105,PhysRevLett.119.157201}. The Yb$^{3+}$ ions form a triangular layer and are surrounded by O$^{2-}$ which construct edge sharing octahedra \cite{srep16419,PhysRevLett.115.167203}. More recently, a class of compounds AReCh$_2$ (A=alkali, Re=rare-earth, Ch=O, S, Se) with perfect triangular lattices of rare-earth ions have been synthesized and explored. The magnetic susceptibilty and heat capacity data suggest no long-range magnetic order or spin freezing down to the lowest measurement temperature, which implies their candidacy for QSL state \cite{acsmaterialslett.9b00464,PhysRevMaterials.3.114413,arXiv1911.08036,Liu_2018,arXiv1911.12712}. The novel magnetic properties of these triangluar magnets may be attributed to the interplay of geometric frustation and exchange frustration induces by spin-orbit coupling.

Inspired by previous theoretical and experimental works, we study the Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$ ($J-K-\Gamma$) model on the triangular lattice. The $J-K-\Gamma$ model Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{equation}
    H=\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle \in \alpha \beta (\gamma)} \lbrack J \bm{S}_i \bm{\cdot} \bm{S}_j + K S_i^{\gamma} S_j^{\gamma} + \Gamma (S_i^{\alpha} S_j^{\beta} + S_i^{\beta} S_j^{\alpha}) \rbrack \label{eq:Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $\langle i,j \rangle$ denotes the NN bonds, $\gamma$ takes value $x$, $y$, or $z$ depending on the direction of the NN bond as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ModelDefinition}(b), and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are the remaining directions. $J$ and $K$ are the magnitude of the Heisenberg and Kitaev interactions and $\Gamma$ the symmetric off-diagonal exchanges. To the best of our knowledge, no exact solution has been reported so far for the spin-1/2 Kitaev and/or $\Gamma$ model on the triangular lattice. Therefore, it remains conceptually interesting to investigate whether the QSL could exist as a possible ground state of the triangular $J-K-\Gamma$ model.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The classical Monte Carlo and exact diagnoalization (ED) methods are introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:SectionII}. Section~\ref{sec:SectionIII} discusses the phases of the classical $J-K-\Gamma$ model with the main focus on the direction of the ordered moment of the FM and stripe states. The global phase diagram of the quantum model is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:SectionIV} along with a discussion of its phases. In Sec.~\ref{sec:SectionV}, we study the moment direction of the quantum FM and stripe states, which provide characteristics to distinguish these phases.

\section{\label{sec:SectionII}Methods}
The full anisotropic Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:Hamiltonian} is no longer exactly solvable, even for the classical case. One, therefore, either has to rely on approximate analytical method or on numerical techniques. To determine the ground state of the Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:Hamiltonian}, we employ a combination of classical Monte Cralo simulation and ED calculation. Here, we briefly describe the methods we used. For convenience, we fix the energy scale with $\sqrt{J^2 + K^2 + \Gamma^2}=1$ and parametrize the exchanges using spherical angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$
\begin{equation}
    J = \sin\alpha \sin\beta, \quad
    K = \sin\alpha \cos\beta, \quad
    \Gamma = \cos\alpha \label{eq:Parameters}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha \in [0, \pi]$ and $\beta \in [0, 2\pi]$ to cover the global phase diagram.

\subsection{\label{sec:SectionIIB}Exact Diagonalization}
We perform Lanczos ED calculations of the GS of the Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:Hamiltonian} on several $4 \times 6$ clusters with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). To detect quantum phase transitions, the second derivatives of the ground state energy, $-\partial^2E_0/\partial\alpha^2$ and $-\partial^2E_0/\partial\beta^2$ were computed and looked for singular features that indicate changes in the ground state characteristics. Phases containing exactly solvable or well-understood points, such as the FM, 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el, stripe and Dual N\'{e}el can be readily identified. To have a better understanding of the characteristics of the remaining phases, we examine the static magnetic structure factor (SMSF) $S(\bm{Q})$ and dynamic spin excitation spectrum $A(\bm{k}, \omega)$ of these phases. $S(\bm{Q})$ and $A(\bm{k}, \omega)$ are defined as follow:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        & S(\bm{Q}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{ij} \langle \Omega | \bm{S}_i \bm{\cdot} \bm{S}_j | \Omega \rangle e^{i \bm{Q} \bm{\cdot} (\bm{R}_i - \bm{R}_j)} \label{eq:SMSF} \\
        & A(\bm{k}, \omega) = -\frac{1}{\pi} \text{Im} G(\bm{k}, \omega) \label{eq:Akomega} \\
        & G(\bm{k}, \omega) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{ij} G_{ij}(\omega) e^{i \bm{k} \cdot (\bm{R}_i - \bm{R}_j)} \\
        & G_{ij}(\omega) = \langle \Omega | S_i^{+} \frac{1}{\omega + i\eta - H + E_0} S_j^{-} | \Omega \rangle \label{eq:GreenFunction}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $| \Omega \rangle$ and $E_0$ are the GS and ground state energy respectively, N is the total number of spins, $\bm{R}_i$ the position of site $i$, and $\eta = 0^+$.

To extract the moment direction of a magnetic ordered phase from a cluster GS, we employ the method developed by Ji\v{r}\'{i} Chaloupka \emph{et  al} \cite{PhysRevB.94.064435}. The basic idea of this method is to measure the probabilities of the exact cluster GS on cluster spin-coherent states with varying moment directions. The cluster spin-coherent state is a direct product of spin-1/2 coherent states on each site $i$
\begin{equation}
    | \Psi \rangle = \bigotimes_{i=1}^N | \theta_i, \phi_i \rangle \label{eq:ClusterCoherentState}
\end{equation}
where the spin-1/2 coherent state
\begin{equation}
    | \theta, \phi \rangle = \mathcal{R}_z(\phi) \mathcal{R}_y(\theta) | \uparrow \rangle = e^{-i \phi S^z} e^{-i \theta S^y} | \uparrow \rangle \label{eq:Spin-1/2CoherentState}
\end{equation}
is fully polaried along the $(\theta, \phi)$ direction. Here the cubic axes are used (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ModelDefinition}(b)), $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the conventional spherical angles, and $S^z | \uparrow \rangle = \frac{1}{2} | \uparrow \rangle$. By calculating the overlap between the exact cluster GS and cluster spin-conherent states, and maximizing the probability $P = | \langle \Psi | GS \rangle|^2$ with respect to $\theta$s and $\phi$s, we can then identify the classical pattern that best fits the exact GS.

\section{\label{sec:SectionIII}Classical Analysis}
To understand the effects of inculding the off-diagonal $\Gamma$ term, we first study the classical $J-K-\Gamma$ model where the spin operators are viewed as unit-vectors in three dimension. On our proceeding, we note that the global phase diagram has been obtained previously by using a combination of Luttinger-Tsiza (LT) and classical Monte Carlo simulations \cite{PhysRevB.92.165108}. Six different magnetic orderings: ferromagnet (FM), stripe, 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el order, nematic, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and dual-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal phases were found, see Fig.~2 in Ref~\onlinecite{PhysRevB.92.165108}. Our classical Monte Carlo study give qualitatively the same phase diagram.

\subsection{\label{sec:SectionIIIA}Moment direction of the classcial FM order}
For the classical FM order, the energy of the $J-K-\Gamma$ model per lattice site is given by
\begin{equation}
    E_{FM}^{c} = (3J + K) + 2 \Gamma (v^x v^y + v^y v^z + v^z v^x) \label{eq:EcFM}
\end{equation}
where $v^x$, $v^y$, $v^z$ are the corresponding components of the classical moment vector. On this level, the moment direction of the classical FM state is determined solely by $\Gamma$ and the problem becomes finding the global minimum and maximum of the multi-variable function $f(v^x, v^y, v^z) = v^x v^y + v^y v^z + v^z v^x$ with the constraint $|\bm{v}| = 1$. $f(v^x, v^y, v^z)$ takes maximum value $f_{max}=1$ at $v^x=v^y=v^z=\pm 1/\sqrt{3}$ and minimum value $f_{min}=-0.5$ when the conditions $v^x + v^y + v^z = 0$ and $|\bm{v}| = 1$ are fulfilled. The condition $v^x + v^y + v^z = 0$ specifies a plane that passes the coordinate origin and is perpendicular to the $[111]$ direction. Considering the reference frame shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ModelDefinition}(b) this is actually the plane of the triangular lattice. That is to say, for $\Gamma > 0$ the ordered moment of the classcial FM state prefers to lie in the lattice plane and when $\Gamma$ is negative, the ordered moment would perpendicular to the lattice plane.

Our classical Monte Carlo simulation found FM ordered state with the right moment direction for majority of the area marked as FM phase (see Fig.~2 in Ref~\onlinecite{PhysRevB.92.165108}) except for the pure $\Gamma$ term. For pure positive $\Gamma$ interaction, apart from the FM order lie in the lattice plane, we also found disordered states which have the same energy as the FM state but no states with lower energy were found. When $\Gamma=-1$, in addition to the FM order perpendicular to the lattice plane, other long-range ordered states which are energetically degenerate with the FM state appear (see Appendix A for details). Based on these observation, it is reasonable to say that the GS of the classical $\Gamma$ model is highly degenerate though the degeneracy may be lifted by introducing other interactions. For example, a ferromagnetic ($J<0$) Heisenberg interaction would break the degeneracy and select the FM ordered state as the GS. On the other hand, when positive Heisenberg interaction is included, which introduces further frustation to the system, the FM order is unlikely to be the GS. In fact, the classical GS were found to be disordered for $0 < J \ll \Gamma$ and stripe ordered for $0 < J \ll -\Gamma$. As for the disordered phase, when quantum flucations are involved, a quantum spin liquid state may emerge.

\subsection{\label{sec:SectionIIIB}Moment direction of the classcial stripe order}
In the case of stripe order, there are three degenerate spin configurations as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b)-(d). For the spin configuration shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b), the energy of the model Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:Hamiltonian} is
\begin{eqnarray}
    E_{StripeX}^{c} & = & -(J + K) + 2 K v^x v^x \nonumber \\
        & & +\: 2 \Gamma (v^y v^z - v^z v^x - v^x v^y) \label{eq:EcStripeX}
\end{eqnarray}
and the energy for spin configuration in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(c) and \ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(d) can be obtained by a cyclic permutation $x \rightarrow y \rightarrow z \rightarrow x$. The ordered moment direction of the classical stripe order is determined by the anisotropy parameters $K$ and $\Gamma$. In general ($J,K,\Gamma \neq 0$), $E_{StripeX}^{c}$ has three extreme points where the first derivatives with respect to $v_x$, $v_y$ and $v_z$ equal zero
\begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:whole}
    \begin{align}
        & \mathbf{v}_0: \quad v_{0}^{y}=-v_{0}^{z} = \pm1/\sqrt{2}, \quad v_{0}^{x} = 0 \label{eq:v0} \\
        & \mathbf{v}_1: \quad v_{1}^{y}=v_{1}^{z} = f_{1}(K, \Gamma), \quad v_{1}^{x} = g_{1}(K, \Gamma) v_{1}^{y} \label{eq:v1} \\
        & \mathbf{v}_2: \quad v_{2}^{y}=v_{2}^{z} = f_{2}(K, \Gamma), \quad v_{2}^{x} = g_{2}(K, \Gamma) v_{2}^{y} \label{eq:v2}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
see Appendix B for their explicit expressions.

For $\Gamma=0, K>0$, it can be clearly seen from Eq.~\eqref{eq:EcStripeX} that $E_{StripeX}^{c}$ takes minimum value at $v^x = 0$ which means that the stripe order shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b) prefers to lie in the $yz$ plane. An infinitesimal positive $\Gamma$ would fix the ordered moment to the $\mathbf{v}_0$ direction whereas negative $\Gamma$ drives it to the $\mathbf{v}_1$ direction. When $\Gamma=0, K<0$, the ordered moment would along the $x$-axis to have lowest energy, both positive and negative $\Gamma$ make it deviate from the $x$-axis and point to the $\mathbf{v}_1$ direction. All these stripe orders with the specific moment direction were found in the corresponding parameter space by our Monte Carlo simulation. However, in the HK limit ($\Gamma=0$), apart from the stripe orders lie in the axis plane, nematic orders which have the same energy were also found in the range $0 \leq |J| \ll K$. The GS of the classical HK model near the antiferromagetic Kitaev point ($K=1$) is high degenerate and both positive and negative $\Gamma$ interactions select specific stripe ordered state as the GS.

\end{figure*}

In this section, we turn to study the quantum phases in the $J-K-\Gamma$ model Hamiltonian. We consider a $4 \times 6$ cluster with PBC that has been used previously to study the KH model on triangular lattice \cite{KaiLi2015}. The resulting phase diagrams for $\Gamma \geq 0$ and $\Gamma \leq 0$ are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(a). The phase boundaries are obtained from the location of singular features in $-\partial^2E_0/\partial\alpha^2$ and $-\partial^2E_0/\partial\beta^2$. The quantum phase diagram is closely resemble to the classical result in Ref~\onlinecite{PhysRevB.92.165108} except for the small green area near $\Gamma=1$ which does not appear in the classical phase diagram.

For pure Heisenberg model ($K=\Gamma=0$), the GS is ferromagnet for $J<0$ and 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el state for $J>0$. As for the KH ($\Gamma=0$) mode, by virtue of the existence of the so-called four-sublattice-transformation (FST) \cite{PhysRevB.89.014414}, two more magnetic ordered phases were identified. Specifically, FST is a spin rotation transformation which divide the triangluar lattice into four sublattices (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ModelDefinition}(c)) and introduce the rotated spin operators $\bm{S}^{'}$: $\bm{S}_{0}^{'} = \bm{S}_0$ for sublattice 0, $\bm{S}_{1}^{'} = (S_1^x, -S_1^y, -S_1^z)$ for sublattice 1, $\bm{S}_{2}^{'} = (-S_2^x, S_2^y, -S_2^z)$ for sublattice 2, and $\bm{S}_{3}^{'} = (-S_3^x, -S_3^y, S_3^z)$ for sublattice 3. The resulting Hamiltonian $H^{'}(\bm{S}^{'})$ has the same form as the original Hamiltonian albeit with different model parameters $J^{'} = -J$ and $K^{'} = 2J + K$. For the spherical angles defined in Eq~\eqref{eq:Parameters}, the mapping takes the form $\alpha^{'}=\alpha=\pi/2, tan\beta^{'}=-sin\beta/(2sin\beta + cos\beta)$. When $\alpha=\pi/2, \beta=\pi - arctan\frac{1}{2}$, the FST maps the Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:Hamiltonian} to FM Heisenberg model of the rotated spin operators $\bm{S}^{'}$. Thus, transformating back to the original spin basis, a collinear stripe order can be obtained. Similarly, a noncollinear spiral order (dual N\'{e}el) at $\alpha=\pi/2, \beta=-arctan\frac{1}{2}$ can be obtained from the 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el order (see Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(e) and (f)). Apart from these well-established phases, the phase near the AF Kitaev point (i.e., $K=1$) has been proposed to be a chiral SL at the mean field level \cite{KaiLi2015} or a nematic phase in the quantum limit from DMRG calculation \cite{PhysRevB.91.155135}, however, a more recent study suggests that a stripe state is more likely to be the GS \cite{PhysRevX.9.021017}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Fig3.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:StructureFactors}(Color online) SMSF for different model paramters. The green dashed lines marks the first BZ corresponding to the triangular lattice.}
\end{figure}

When the off-diagonal $\Gamma$ term is included, the transforamtion is no longer valid. To identify the remaining phases, we calculate the SMSF for some representative model paramters, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:StructureFactors}. For pure $\Gamma$ model, see Fig.~\ref{fig:StructureFactors}(a) and (b), the peak of the SMSF locates at the center of first Brillouin Zone (BZ) which is a typical characteristic of the FM order. Based on this observation, we propose the three blue areas with different shadings in the global phase diagram (see Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}) to be FM ordered phases (i.e., FM-A, FM-B, FM-C) and they different from each other in the direction of the ordered moment which will be discussed in the Sec.~\ref{sec:SectionV}. The ground states of the quantum model in these area are similar to their classical analogue except for the pure $\Gamma$ model. For $\Gamma=1$, the GS of the classical model is highly degenerate including FM ordered states and states with no long range order. However, for the quantum model, quantum flucations select the FM ordered states as GS out of an otherwise infinitely degenerate manifold of classical states. This selection of states among a continuum is the so called "order-from-disorder" mechanism previously emphasized by Villain and Henley in the context of the square lattice XY model \cite{PhysRevLett.62.2056} and by Oguchi \emph{et al.,} in the case of fcc antiferromagnet \cite{JPSJ.54.4494}. Similarly, the degeneracy for the classical model at $\Gamma=-1$ is lifted by quantum flucations and the FM ordered state is selected as the GS.

For these areas marked as Stripe-A, Stripe-B, Stripe-C and Stripe-D in the global phase diagram, the representative SMSF profiles are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:StructureFactors}(c)-(e). For all of these model parameters, the SMSF peaked at the midpoints of the first BZ boundary (i.e., M-points) indicating that the stripe ordered GS of the classical model persist in the quantum limit. It is worth to note that even the GS of the classical model near the AF Kitaev point was identified to be nematic ordered which is energetically degenerate with the stripe state, our ED results favor the idea that quantum flucations would select a stripe state. The four stripe phases designated as Stripe-A, Stripe-B, Stripe-C, Stripe-D in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(a) different from each other only in the moment direction.

(b) Spin excitation spectrum for $\alpha=0.05\pi,\beta=0.10\pi$. The $A(\bm{k}, \omega)$ is draw along the path shown in (a).}
\end{figure}

Apart from these single-$\mathbf{Q}$ phases, we also identify a multi-$\mathbf{Q}$ phase, see the green area in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(a). For $J$, $K$, $\Gamma$ in this area, the SMSF has high intensities at both the center and M-points of the first BZ. Fig.~\ref{fig:StructureFactors}(f) is a typical SMSF profile of this phase. To have further understanding of the characteristics of this phase, we also calculate the spin excitation spectrum and a typical $A(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$ profile is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Spectrum}(b). The high intensities at both the center and M-points of the first BZ is consistent with SMSF data. Moreover, there are continuum spectrum at high energy which is a characteristic of QSL. However, the $A(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$ does not have intensities at $\omega = 0$ which indicates the system described by the corresponding model Hamiltonian is gapped. Combined with all of the above results, we propose the GS of quantum $J-K-\Gamma$ model at the green area is a gapped QSL.

Having map out the global phase diagram of the $J-K-\Gamma$ model, we now move to the moment direction of these FM and stripe phases which provides key characteristic to distinguish them. Since the cluster spin-coherent state is captured by only a single pair ($\theta$, $\phi$) for collinear phases (in our case, these are FM and stripe), it is easy to determine the direction of the ordered moment by inspecting the probability map $P(\theta, \phi) = | \langle \Psi (\theta, \phi) | GS \rangle |^2$.

\subsection{\label{sec:SectionVA}Moment direction of the FM phases}
For pure Heisenberg model, the FM state is spin rotational invariant and the ordered moment can point any direction. The easy axis Kitaev interaction breaks the accidental spin rotational symmetry, pinning the orderings to the axis direction (i.e., $x$, $y$, $z$ direction). However, when the off-diagonal $\Gamma$ term is introduced, which would compete with Kitaev interaction, the moment orientation will deviate from the axis direction. To extract the moment direction of the FM-A and FM-C phases, we calculate the probabilities $P(\theta, \phi)$ with varying $\theta$s and $\phi$s. The resulting probability maps are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Proabilities}(a) and \ref{fig:Proabilities}(b). For the FM-A phase, the probability map reveals the moment being constrained to the lattice plane (marked by the green dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:Proabilities}(a)) with all directions degenerate. The probability map for the FM-C phase is clearly peaked at the direction perpendicular to the lattice plane (marked by the green solid circle in \ref{fig:Proabilities}(b)).

\subsection{\label{sec:SectionVB}Moment direction of the stripe phases}
The stripe phases have three degenerate patterns as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b)-(d) and the ordered moment is locked to the orientation of the stripe pattern. For brevity, we only construct cluster spin-coherent state based on the stripe pattern shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b) and present the probability maps in Fig.~\ref{fig:Proabilities}(c)-(f) for Stripe-A, Stripe-B, Stripe-C, Stripe-D respectively. In the HK limit, the Stripe-A phase is connected to the FM-B phase through FST and the spins are supposed to along the $x$-axis for stripe pattern in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}(b) from classical considerations, our ED results show that this situation also applies at quantum limit (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Proabilities}(c)). As for the Stripe-D phase near the AF Kitaev point, the probability map Fig.~\ref{fig:Proabilities}(f) reveals the moment being constrained to the vicinity of the $yz$ plane, as predicted by classical analysis. Within this plane, the order-from-disorder mechanism selects the cubic axes $y$ and $z$ where the probability reaches its maxima. The small $P_{max}$ of about 3\% can be partly attributed to the cluster GS being a superposition of six possible classical stripe states, more importantly it a signature of large quantum flucations in the ground state.

The main effect of $\Gamma$ term on the Stripe-A and Stripe-D phase is tilting the moment orientation away from the cubic axes directions, yielding the Stripe-B and Stripe-C phase. Fig.~\ref{fig:Proabilities}(e) is a representative probability map for the Stripe-B phase. The probability takes maximum value at the direction determined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:S1}, which means that the moment direction changes with the model parameters $K$ and $\Gamma$. On the other hand, the case of the Stripe-C phase is rather different. The probability is clearly peaked at the direction given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:S0} with the maximum value $P_{max}$ considerably less than $\frac{1}{6}$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Proabilities}(d)). Apart from the overall reduction factor of $\frac{1}{6}$ due to the six possible stripe states being superposed in the cluster GS, quantum flucations may take responsibilities for the reduced probability.
